What is this?
-------------
UITweaks is a collection of configurable tweaks and addons for the default UI. It uses a plugin architecture, which allows for in-game enabling/disabling of each plugin, and does not overwrite any of the default game files.

Since each plugin is intended to work against the default UI, any custom mods you use that overwrite default UI files will probably cause strange compatibility issues.
   
   
Plugins
-------
 * Ability Bar DeFX - ability bar visual fx adjustments.
 * Black Background Removal - hide the black faded background at the bottom of the screen, but still allow the in-combat indicator to show.
 * Character Sheet Zoom - manual static character sheet zoom setting.
 * Inspecto Patronum - revamped Character Inspection panel, including equipment statistics.
 * Resize Altered States - manual static size adjustment for combat states (e.g. Weakened etc).
 * Target Of Target - display windows for your offensive target's offensive & defensive target; great for tanking and healing! 
   
   
User Configuration
------------------
An in-game config icon is available, which also integrates with Viper's Topbar Information Overload (VTIO).  Clicking the icon opens the configuration window where each plugin can be enabled/disabled and any available plugin settings can be selected.
   
   
Known Issues
------------
Switching characters causes the config window to become empty.  The workaround is to do a /reloadui after switching characters.

   
Installation
------------

This will add the appropriate directory and put the files in the right place.

Uninstallation
